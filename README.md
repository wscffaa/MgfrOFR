Official implementation of **Multi-Granularity Feature Decomposition with Ranking-Aware Regularization for Old Film Restoration**.

MgfrOFR is an old-film restoration framework built on a recurrent video restoration backbone. It introduces multi-granularity feature decomposition for degradation-aware restoration and ranking-aware temporal regularization for more stable video recovery.

> Paper, pretrained weights, and benchmark links will be updated after the final camera-ready/release assets are frozen.

## News

- **2026-05-10**: Initial public-release codebase prepared with training/testing configs and BasicOFR/BasicSR runtime.

## Highlights

- **Old-film restoration focus**: designed for mixed analog degradations such as scratches, noise, blur, flicker, and local structured artifacts.
- **Multi-granularity feature decomposition**: adds MGFE modules to separate restoration cues at different feature granularities.
- **Ranking-aware temporal regularization**: provides a training loss for temporally consistent restoration behavior.
- **Reproducible configs**: includes full-model and ablation configs for training and testing.
- **Standalone release**: packages the required `mgfrofr`, `basicofr`, and `basicsr` code paths in one repository.

## TODO

- [ ] Add paper link.
- [ ] Add pretrained model download URLs and SHA256 checksums.
- [ ] Add final benchmark tables after metric provenance is frozen.
- [ ] Add qualitative examples and teaser figure.

## Installation

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wscffaa/MgfrOFR.git
cd MgfrOFR
```

### 2. Create Environment

```bash
conda create -n mgfrofr python=3.10 -y
conda activate mgfrofr
```

Install PyTorch according to your CUDA version from the official PyTorch instructions. For example:

```bash
# Example only. Pick the command matching your CUDA/driver.
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

Then install the remaining dependencies and this repository:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

`mamba-ssm` and CUDA extensions can be environment-sensitive. If installation fails, install the PyTorch/CUDA-compatible wheel first and then rerun `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Quick Check

Run the lightweight smoke test after installation:

```bash
python tests/test_mgfrofr_smoke.py
```

Expected output:

```text
MgfrOFR import, registry, and config smoke test passed
```

This checks package imports, registry entries, and YAML config parsing. It does not require pretrained restoration weights.

## Dataset Preparation

This repository does not redistribute REDS, SRWOV, or third-party datasets. Please download datasets from their official sources and arrange them as follows:

```text
datasets/OldFilmRestoration/
├── train/
│   └── REDS/train_sharp/
├── val/
│   ├── miniREDS/
│   │   ├── GT/val_sharp/
│   │   └── LQ/val_sharp_degraded/
│   ├── REDS/
│   │   ├── GT/val_sharp/
│   │   └── LQ/val_sharp_degraded/
│   └── RealFilm/MambaOFR_SRWOV/
└── noise_data/
```

See [docs/DATASETS.md](docs/DATASETS.md) for more notes.

## Model Zoo

Weights are not committed to git. Put downloaded models under `pretrained/`:

```text
pretrained/
├── mambaofr_reds_16_net_g_best.pth
├── mgfrofr_a3_full.pth
└── mgfrofr_a0_mambaofr.pth
```

| Model | Config | Download | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MgfrOFR-A3 full | `options/test/mgfrofr_a3_synthetic.yml` | To be released | Full MGFE + RATR model |
| MgfrOFR-A0 baseline | `options/train/mgfrofr_a0_mambaofr.yml` | To be released | Baseline reference |
| MambaOFR warm start | `options/train/mgfrofr_a3_full.yml` | To be released | Used for warm-start training |

See [docs/MODEL_ZOO.md](docs/MODEL_ZOO.md). Add checksums before publishing pretrained weights.

## Evaluation

### Synthetic REDS-style Evaluation

```bash
python scripts/test.py -opt options/test/mgfrofr_a3_synthetic.yml
```

Outputs are saved under `results/`.

### Real-world Old-film Evaluation

```bash
python scripts/test.py -opt options/test/mgfrofr_a3_realworld.yml
```

The real-world config saves restored frames and does not require ground-truth frames.

## Training

Full MgfrOFR training:

```bash
python scripts/train.py -opt options/train/mgfrofr_a3_full.yml
```

Ablation configs:

| Config | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `options/train/mgfrofr_a0_mambaofr.yml` | recurrent baseline |
| `options/train/mgfrofr_a1_mgfe.yml` | baseline + MGFE |
| `options/train/mgfrofr_a2_ratr.yml` | baseline + RATR |
| `options/train/mgfrofr_a3_full.yml` | MGFE + RATR full model |

Training logs and checkpoints are written to `experiments/` and `tb_logger/`, both ignored by git.

## Results

Final paper metrics will be added after the evaluation protocol, checkpoint hashes, and metric provenance are frozen. See [docs/RESULTS.md](docs/RESULTS.md) for the intended reporting fields.

When reporting results, please include:

- checkpoint file and hash;
- config file;
- dataset split;
- metric implementation;
- exact command;
- date and environment.
